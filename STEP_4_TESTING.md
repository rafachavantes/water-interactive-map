# Step 4 Testing Checklist

> **Quick testing guide for Step 4: Load Drawings on Page Refresh**

## Before You Start Testing

**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Step 3 complete (at least one drawing saved in database)
- [ ] Database has drawings with `approvalStatus = "approved"`
- [ ] Page header has `bubble-freehand-header-v2.html` script
- [ ] Page load workflow created with JavaScript action

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Page Load (Single Drawing)

**Setup:**
1. Ensure database has exactly 1 approved drawing
2. Note the drawing's ID and type from database

**Test Steps:**
1. Open page in preview mode
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Wait for page to fully load

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Console shows: `üîÑ Step 4: Loading drawings from database...`
- [ ] Console shows: `üìä Found 1 approved drawings to render`
- [ ] Console shows: `‚úÖ Map ready, starting to render 1 drawings`
- [ ] Console shows: `üñºÔ∏è Rendering drawing 1/1 - ID: [id]`
- [ ] Console shows: `‚úÖ Drawing rendered successfully`
- [ ] Console shows: `üéâ All drawings rendered! Total: 1`
- [ ] Console shows: `üó∫Ô∏è Map bounds fitted to show all drawings`
- [ ] Drawing visible on map in correct location
- [ ] Center marker visible (for line/polygon)
- [ ] No errors in console

**Debug Commands:**
```javascript
// Check if map captured
window.__leafy_found_map

// Check stored layers
window.__drawing_layers

// Count layers
Object.keys(window.__drawing_layers).length  // Should be 1
```

---

### Test 2: Multiple Drawings Load

**Setup:**
1. Create 3-5 approved drawings using Step 3
2. Vary drawing types (mix of polylines, polygons)
3. Use different colors

**Test Steps:**
1. Refresh page (or open in new preview)
2. Watch console output

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Console shows correct count: `Found X approved drawings`
- [ ] All drawings appear on map
- [ ] Each drawing has correct color from database
- [ ] All center markers visible
- [ ] Map zooms to fit all drawings
- [ ] No coordinate conversion errors
- [ ] No rendering errors

**Visual Check:**
- [ ] Polylines are solid lines (not dashed)
- [ ] Colors match database values
- [ ] Drawings in Brazil region (lat ~-23, lng ~-47)
- [ ] No drawings in ocean/wrong continent

---

### Test 3: Empty Database (Zero Drawings)

**Setup:**
1. Delete all drawings OR change all to `approvalStatus = "pending"`

**Test Steps:**
1. Refresh page
2. Check console

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Console shows: `Found 0 approved drawings to render`
- [ ] Console shows: `‚ÑπÔ∏è No drawings to display, keeping default map view`
- [ ] No errors about undefined/null
- [ ] Map shows default view (no crash)

---

### Test 4: Coordinate Format Verification

**Setup:**
1. Have at least one drawing in database
2. Note the first coordinate pair from database

**Test Steps:**
1. Load page with console open
2. Look for coordinate conversion logs

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Console shows: `üîÑ Converted X coordinates from GeoJSON to Leaflet format`
- [ ] If first coordinate in DB is `[-47.607, -23.499]` (GeoJSON [lng, lat])
- [ ] Console log should show conversion to `[-23.499, -47.607]` (Leaflet [lat, lng])
- [ ] Drawing appears in correct location (Brazil)

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check a specific drawing's stored data
var firstDrawingId = Object.keys(window.__drawing_layers)[0];
window.__drawing_layers[firstDrawingId].data
```

---

### Test 5: Click Handler Functionality

**Setup:**
1. Load page with drawings visible

**Test Steps:**
1. Click on a drawing line
2. Click on a center marker

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Console shows: `üñ±Ô∏è Drawing clicked: [id]` (when clicking line)
- [ ] Console shows: `üñ±Ô∏è Center marker clicked: [id]` (when clicking marker)
- [ ] Warning about `bubble_fn_drawing_selected` not being a function is OK (Step 5 not implemented yet)

---

### Test 6: Map Bounds Fitting

**Setup:**
1. Have 2-3 drawings spread across different locations

**Test Steps:**
1. Load page
2. Observe initial map view

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Map automatically zooms to show all drawings
- [ ] Padding visible around drawings (not cut off at edges)
- [ ] Zoom level reasonable (not too close, not too far)
- [ ] Max zoom = 15 applied (doesn't over-zoom for single drawing)

---

### Test 7: Different Drawing Types

**Setup:**
1. Create one of each type:
   - Point marker
   - Polyline (line or freehand)
   - Polygon (area)

**Test Steps:**
1. Load page with all three visible

**Expected Results:**

**For Point:**
- [ ] Console shows: `üìç Created point marker`
- [ ] Single marker appears
- [ ] No center marker created (point itself is the marker)
- [ ] Marker has colored circle with white border

**For Polyline:**
- [ ] Console shows: `üìè Created polyline with X points`
- [ ] Line appears solid (not dashed)
- [ ] Center marker appears
- [ ] Both line and marker clickable

**For Polygon:**
- [ ] Console shows: `üî∑ Created polygon with X vertices`
- [ ] Polygon shape appears
- [ ] Fill opacity = 0.3 (semi-transparent)
- [ ] Center marker appears
- [ ] Both polygon and marker clickable

---

### Test 8: Performance Test (Large Dataset)

**Setup:**
1. Create 20+ approved drawings

**Test Steps:**
1. Load page
2. Measure time from "Loading drawings" to "All drawings rendered"

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Page loads in < 3 seconds
- [ ] All drawings render smoothly
- [ ] No browser lag or freezing
- [ ] Map interactions still responsive
- [ ] No memory issues

---

### Test 9: Page Refresh Persistence

**Setup:**
1. Load page with drawings visible

**Test Steps:**
1. Hard refresh page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Close preview and reopen

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] All drawings reappear on refresh
- [ ] Same count of drawings
- [ ] Same colors and positions
- [ ] Layer storage recreated correctly

---

### Test 10: Privacy Filtering (If Implemented)

**Setup:**
1. Have drawings with different privacy settings
2. Test as different user roles

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as Admin ‚Üí Load page ‚Üí Note visible drawings
2. Login as Ditch Rider ‚Üí Load page ‚Üí Note visible drawings
3. Login as User ‚Üí Load page ‚Üí Note visible drawings

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Admin sees all approved drawings
- [ ] Ditch Rider sees filtered drawings per privacy
- [ ] User sees filtered drawings per privacy
- [ ] Console count matches visible count

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Map not ready yet" loops forever

**Check:**
```javascript
window.__leafy_found_map  // Should return map object after ~1-2 seconds
```

**Solutions:**
- Ensure page header script is present
- Check Leafy Maps element is visible
- Run `window.__leafy_try_capture_now()` manually

---

### Issue: Drawings don't appear but console shows success

**Check:**
1. Are coordinates reasonable? (Not [0,0] or [null, null])
2. Run in console:
   ```javascript
   Object.values(window.__drawing_layers).map(d => d.data)
   ```
3. Pan/zoom map manually to look for drawings

**Solutions:**
- Check coordinate format in database
- Verify coordinate conversion is happening
- Check if drawings are outside current map view

---

### Issue: Drawings in wrong location (ocean, wrong country)

**Check coordinate conversion:**
```javascript
// Example Brazil coordinate
var testCoord = [-47.607, -23.499];  // GeoJSON [lng, lat]
var leafletCoord = [testCoord[1], testCoord[0]];  // Should be [-23.499, -47.607]
console.log('GeoJSON:', testCoord, '‚Üí Leaflet:', leafletCoord);
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify `.map(c => [c[1], c[0]])` is in code
- Check database coordinates are in GeoJSON format
- Brazil: lat should be ~-23 (not -47)

---

### Issue: Console errors about JSON.parse

**Check data types:**
```javascript
// In database, coordinates should be text field containing:
'[[-47.607, -23.499], [-47.608, -23.500], ...]'

// NOT:
- Empty string
- "null"
- Invalid JSON
```

**Solutions:**
- Check database field is not null
- Verify JSON is valid (use JSON validator)
- Re-save drawing using Step 3 if corrupted

---

## Success Criteria Summary

**All tests passing means:**
- ‚úÖ Drawings load automatically on page refresh
- ‚úÖ Correct coordinate format conversion
- ‚úÖ All drawing types render correctly
- ‚úÖ Click handlers working
- ‚úÖ Map bounds fitting working
- ‚úÖ Performance acceptable
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ Ready for Step 5 (drawing selection)

## Next Steps After All Tests Pass

1. **Proceed to Step 5:** Drawing selection workflow
2. **Add privacy filtering:** If not yet implemented
3. **Optimize performance:** If loading >100 drawings
