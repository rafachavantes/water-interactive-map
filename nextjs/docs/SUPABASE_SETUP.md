# Supabase Database Setup Instructions

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Required Database Migration

The contact information feature requires database schema updates that must be
manually applied to your Supabase database.

## Step 1: Apply the Initial Schema

If you haven't already, run the main schema file in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Click **Run**

## Step 2: Apply the Contact Fields Migration

**This step is required for contact information to work:**

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-migration-contact-fields.sql`
4. Click **Run**

This migration will:

- Add contact fields to all entity tables
- Add contact fields to the drawings table
- Insert sample data with contact information
- Create performance indexes

## Step 3: Verify the Migration

After running the migration, verify it worked by checking one of the entity
tables:

```sql
SELECT id, name, contact_name, contact_phone, contact_email, contact_role 
FROM canals 
LIMIT 3;
```

You should see contact information like:

- **canal-1**: John Smith, (555) 123-4567, john.smith@waterdistrict.gov, Canal
  Manager
- **canal-2**: Maria Rodriguez, (555) 234-5678, maria.rodriguez@westbranch.com,
  Canal Owner
- **canal-3**: David Chen, (555) 345-6789, david.chen@eastbranch.org,
  Maintenance Supervisor

## Step 4: Environment Variables

Ensure your environment variables are properly set:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Step 5: Test the Feature

1. Restart your Next.js application
2. Create a new drawing element with type **canal**, **ride**, **headgate**, or
   **meter**
3. In the Details panel, select an entity from the "Link to" dropdown
4. The Contact Information section should auto-populate with the entity's
   contact details

## Troubleshooting

### If contact information doesn't populate:

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify API response** by visiting: `/api/entities/canal`
   - Should include `contactName`, `contactPhone`, `contactEmail`, `contactRole`
     fields
3. **Ensure migration was successful** by running the verification query above
4. **Check Supabase logs** for any database errors

### Common Issues:

- **"Failed to fetch entities"**: Check your environment variables
- **Empty contact fields**: Migration wasn't applied successfully
- **"Table doesn't exist"**: Run the initial schema first, then the migration
- **Permission errors**: Ensure you're using the service role key, not the anon
  key
